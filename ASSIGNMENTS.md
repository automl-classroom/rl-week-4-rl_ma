# Assignments
There are two possible workflows:
1. Working in the assignment repo (and potentially copying over old soltions)
2. Working in a master repo and pushing to different remotes
Either way, autograding will test your solutions on GitHub. 
If you don't want to wait for the online test, you can optionally run that same workflow locally with tools like [Act](https://nektosact.com/introduction.html) or from within your IDE as in [VS Code](https://sanjulaganepola.github.io/github-local-actions-docs/). 
This is not mandatory and `make test` should behave the same, but it emulates the remote test case more closely in case you're worried about e.g. pathing.
We recommend always running `make test` first.

## Workflow 1: Working in the assignment repo
You don't need to do more than accepting the assignment and cloning the repo.
The normal `git push` pushes your commits to the assignment repo where they are automatically graded.

## Workflow 2: Using one working repo, push to assignment repos
In order for us to evaluate your solutions we rely on github classroom.

However, we have one common repo so you can keep everything at one place.

This however needs some trickery and we prepared a recipe for you.

First of all, you need to FORK the [master repo](https://github.com/automl-edu/RL-exercises). Best would be using the github web interface.
If you work as a team, add your team members to the repo so you can all push to it.
Then you can clone your repo:

  `git clone git@github.com:<YOURUSERNAME>/RL-exercises.git`
  `cd RL-exercises`

(probably you have done this step if you have followed the installation instructions in `README.md`)


Now you have the skeleton for the individual exercises.

If we publish a new exercise then you need to click on the assignment link and accept it. Remember your repo, mine would be for week 1 `automl-edu/week-1-introduction-benjamc` .

The important thing is that you work in the master repository but push to the assignment repos. This is how it works:

You first add the remote like so:

`git remote add week1 git@github:automl-edu/week-1-introduction-benjamc.git` 

`week1` is the identifier of the remote and maybe you noticed the ID of the assignment repo.

After that, pull possible changes

`git pull week1 main --allow-unrelated-histories`

Maybe you need to merge and setup the merge:

1.  `git config pull.rebase false`
2. add all changes if necessary `git add *`
3. `git commit -m "Merge week1"`

You should be able to push to the new repo: `git push week1 main`

For the following weeks replace the number of the week remote identifier `week1` and your assignment repo.
